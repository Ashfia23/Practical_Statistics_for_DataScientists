# Practical_Statistics_for_Data Scientists
This repository goes through the concepts of statistics discussed in the Book "Practical Statistics for Data Scientists" by Andrew Bruce, Peter C. Bruce, and Peter Gedeck in a lucid manner with the help of python.

Concepts are implemented in a easy to understand manner with some codes changed if a more easy alternative of implementation appears in a different library of python.
